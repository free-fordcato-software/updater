FS has been updated to add whole bunch of customization features. With these features - possibility of crashes arise, especially when i suck at programming. Thats why we are testing game!!!


<b>!!IMPORTANT!!</b>
If FS crashes, please tell me about it!! Write what you been doing (obviously playing, duh), and SEND ME CRASHDUMP!! This is very important, without that i cant trace what exactly happened.

Crashdumps should be located at \"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\dumps\". Usually newest one is the one that we both need.


Anyway, here is list of new features:
- added loadout ui
- new skins, agents
- new weapon anim
- new maps:
- - fs_prison
- - fs_trainstation
- - fs_citadel
- revamped menu
- LOBBY SYSTEM IN FRIENDLY STUNSTICK
- updater system (it is being abused right now to show this message)
- vocalizer
- voting system"
