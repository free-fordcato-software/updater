    "changelog": "The Long, Not So Awaited Third Year In A Row Failed Halloween UPDATE!\n\n\nIn this post-Halloween update, FS celebrates its 3 year (plus 3 months and a couple of days) anniversary with a slew of exhilarating enhancements.\n\nPlayers can now tailor their loadouts seamlessly through the new loadout UI, while new skins, playermodels, and weapon animations allow you to further customize the look of your game. The addition of three \"\"\"new\"\"\" maps: citadel, prison and trainstation, offer a couple more areas from the original game for you to stunstick in. A revamped menu ensures smoother navigation, and the groundbreaking lobby system introduces unparalleled organization for player matches. Stay informed with the new update notification system, annoy your opponents more effectively with the vocalizer feature, and exercise your democratic right by voting for your favorite map, or kicking whoever is getting on your nerves. Finally, relive epic moments and learn from experiences with the match replay feature. "
